# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-using-Dual-stream-Multiscale-3D-UNET-with-Densenet-and-Spatial-Attention
The goal of this study is to develop an accurate segmentation technique that can accurately identify regions of interest in medical images in this case for brain tumor imaging. For this, we developed a novel dual stream spatial attention Multiscale 3D-UNET with denseness blocks model.
